elite campus ambassador program. In the context of

“Ninjathon” for all the campus “Ninjas” where Ninjas
are divided in teams of 10 to make a working website
based on Covid-19 situation which should be useful
for community in this time of crisis.
For the above mentioned program, our team named
<b>“Rogan Josh”</b> has developed a stock price predictor,
embedded on a website named <b>Trade Racer</b>. It finds
application in predicting future price for different
stocks in these days, when markets are much
volatile for investors and traders. This blog gives an
insight of this platform, ranging from its formulation
to Stock Market prediction and analysis is the act of

<p>Stock Market prediction and analysis is the act of trying to determine
    the future value of a company stock or other financial instrument traded on an exchange.

Stock market is the important part of economy of the
country and plays a vital role in the growth of the
industry and commerce of the country that
eventually affects the economy of the country. Both
investors and industry are involved in stock market
and wants to know whether some stock will rise or
fall over certain period of time. The stock market is
the primary source for any company to raise funds
for business expansions. It is based on the concept
of demand and supply. If the demand for a
c Due to involvement of many number of industries
and companies, it contain very large sets of data
from which it is difficult to extract information and
analyze their trend of work manually. Stock market
analysis and prediction reveals the market patterns
and predict the time to purchase stock. The
successful prediction of a stock's future price could
yield significant profit.</p><br><h2><b>Facing market volatility with TradeRacer</b></h2>
<p>Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, the global stock markets are facing backlash and stocks of some
giants are trading at their yearly or even lifetime
lows. The sentiment in the stock markets across the
world is gloomy. Financial markets in India are
witnessing sharp volatility currently as a result of
the fallout in global markets. Further, with overseas
investors (FPIs) flying to the safety of dollar-backed
assets from emerging markets has led to a sharp downfall in the Indian Stock Market. S&P BSE Sensex which was 42273 points on 20 January, 2020 is 29894 points on 08 April, 2020 and the fall is expected to continue in coming days where results of corporates will be submerged under the 2 months nationwide lockdown. Investors have lost huge capital in this time of crisis and are trading cautiously these days with an optimistic approach. But we know that getting the bottom of markets have never been possible, but with some analysis and interpretation of movement of stocks previously, we can get targets of stocks in the coming days.
<br><br>That’s where Trade Racer comes in action, a platform which can assist the investors and traders for the upcoming moves of the stocks in the near future or for the long term prospective by its detailed analysis of the stocks.
<br><br>Trade Racer gives you best possible price prediction for most of the stocks to maximize your capital gains.

<ul type="square">
    <li>To identify factors affecting share market</li>
<li>To generate the pattern from large set of data of
stock market for prediction of various aspects of
a stock</li>
<li>To predict an approximate value of share price<li>
<li>To provide analysis for users through web

<h3 style="color: black; font-weight: bold; font-style: normal;">Getting Started with TradeRacer</h3>
<br>
<p>
Predicting how the stock market will perform is one
of the most difficult things to do. There are so many
factors involved in the prediction – physical factors
vs. psychological, rational and irrational policies of
Governments, and Global economic scenario. All
these aspects combine to make share prices volatile
and very difficult to predict with a high degree of
accuracy.</p>
<p>In this project, we are working with historical data
about the stock prices of a publicly listed company.
We will implement a mix of machine learning
algorithms to predict the future stock price of this
company, starting with simple algorithms like
averaging and linear regression, and then moving on
to advanced techniques like Auto ARIMA and LSTM.
The main feature of this project is to generate an
approximate forecasting output and create a general
idea of future values based on the previous data by
generating a pattern. The scope of this project does
not exceed more than a generalized suggestion tool.
The project will be useful for investors to invest in
stock market based on the various factors.</p><br><br>
<h3 style="color: black">COVID-19: A Black swan Event</h3>
<br>
<p>COVID-19 is a black swan event
Throughout history, there have been highly
improbable events that catch almost everyone by
surprise and can potentially have a large impact on
the world by disrupting human activities and
creating havoc. Such kind of events are called black
swans. The name stems from the fact that until
1697, mankind believed that all swans were white.
Then Dutch explorers sighted black swans for the
first time in Western Australia, completely nullifying
the belief that swans can only be white. Thus, the
term „black swan‟ morphed into describing an event
that occurred despite seeming impossible. Black
swan is the occurrence of a highly unexpected event
that also has an extreme impact. The field of finance
regularly attempts to capture outlier events and fails
with equal regularity. Impact of novel coronavirus
(COVID-19) on the stock market is one such event,
which has all characteristics of black swan.
The worldwide Stock market has a history of crash
and recovery and the Indian Stock Market is no
different from that. Sensex plunged 53 per cent in
one year in “Harshad Mehta Scam” (1992) but
recovered 127 per cent in 1.5 years. During the
“Asian Crisis” (1996) Sensex dipped 40 per cent in
four years but recovered 115 per cent in one year.
When the US faced the “Real Estate – Lehman” crisis
(2008) Sensex crashed 61 percent in a year but
recovered 157 per cent in 1.5 years. The current
market has crashed around 30 per cent in less than
three months. Some Experts even compare this
meltdown of economies with the “Great Depression”
of the 20th Century. It would be foolish to expect a
quick economic rebound from the current COVID-19
effect.</p>
<p>Though the financial crisis is inevitable, considering
all-out efforts by central banks and fiscal
authorities, to soften the blow, deep economic slump
might be avoided. Trade-in 2020 is expected to fall
steeply in every region of the world and basically
across all sectors. But global trade could rebound
rapidly after that. However, it would depend on how
quickly the pandemic is brought under control, and
the policy choices which the governments took to
support their economies.</p>
<p>It is true about the market that whether it is the
correction or growth, both phases make equity or
stock market interesting and worth taking
exposures.</p>

<br>
<h3 style="color: black;">Conclusion</h3>
<br><p>Predicting the Stock Market has been the ultimate
desire of investors since its existence. Everyday
billions of dollars are traded on the exchange, and
behind each dollar is an investor hoping to profit in
one way or another. It is no wonder then that the
Stock Market and its associated challenges find their
way into the public imagination every time it
misbehaves.</p>
<p>IMF has predicted that Global GDP will grow with a
meager 2.5% rate for FY2020 and so will be the case
with India whose GDP growth may remain between
2-3% for FY2020 and may also be negative in
FY2021 as per RBI governor in his recent press
briefing. But global analyst are also in the favour
that it may take some time to recover, but after that
time will be favourable to stock markets and GDPs of
different countries. Moreover, India may see a strong
demand and a quick reversal from the present in the
future, where it's GDP growth may see a long spike
till FY2020. So we expect that economies may suffer
after lockdown for a short span of time but the
coming future will be bright for Global economies
with a strong demand and reversal, but it will take
some time to grow investor‟s investments
exponentially.</p>
<p>Perhaps a better platform of stock market prediction
might help investors to reap most out of the markets
and Trade Racer can act as such a platform.</p><br><br>
